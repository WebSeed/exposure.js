**XHR Same-Origin Policy**

The same-origin policy applies to XMLHttpRequests unless the server provides an Access-Control-Allow-Origin (CORS - cross-origin resource sharing) header.

**JSONP (for GET)**

JSONP allows a page to receive JSON data from a different domain by adding a ```script``` element to the page which loads a JSON response from a different domain.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

CORS can be used as a modern alternative to the JSONP pattern.
